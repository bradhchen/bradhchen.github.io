				<p>
					My name is Bradley Chen and I am studying Information Systems with an intended double major in Business Administration at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I am interested in studying how businesses can best leverage information systems in order to gain advantages over competitors. Specifically, I am interested in how this applies in the world of finance. I am skilled in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, AutoCAD, and individual and team project development. I have done projects in my classes here at Carnegie Mellon as well as for NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, where I assisted a team of researchers in the Space Biosciences Department by developing a program that assisted in their statistical analysis of data generated by VESGEN, a vessel imaging program. At school, I am involved in the Varsity swim team, Tepper Finance Group, specifically the Introductory Finance Society, as well as Quant, a club studying quantitative finance. In my free time I enjoy running, swimming, lifting weights, and watching movies.
