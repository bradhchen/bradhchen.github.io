					<li>15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Science</li>
					<dd>A technical introduction to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Starting from first principles, 15-112 covers a large subset of the Python programming language, including its standard libraries and programming paradigms. 15-112 also targets numerous deployment scenarios, including standalone programs, shell scripts, and web-based applications.</dd><br>

					<li>67-250 Information Systems Milieux</li>
					<dd>Information systems (IS) are changing work practices, reshaping organizations, transforming cultures, and giving new meaning to the ways we see the world. This course is designed to help students understand the role of IS in the enterprise and the means by which these systems are created, utilized and maintained. The course will focus on enterprise information architecture including the components of enterprise strategy, business, application, information, and infrastructure layers. This course provides not only a framework for understanding information systems, but also a language to identify their dynamic complexities and interdependencies.</dd><br>

					<li>21-127 Concepts of Mathematics</li>
					<dd>This course introduces the basic concepts, ideas and tools involved in doing mathematics. As such, its main focus is on presenting informal logic, and the methods of mathematical proof. These subjects are closely related to the application of mathematics in many areas, particularly computer science. Topics discussed include a basic introduction to elementary number theory, induction, the algebra of sets, relations, equivalence relations, congruences, partitions, and functions, including injections, surjections, and bijections. A basic introduction to the real numbers, rational and irrational numbers. Supremum and infimum of a set.</dd><br>
					<li>73-102 Principles of Microeconomics</li>
					<dd>Students will learn how microeconomic analysis can explain market successes, market failures, and how government intervention might improve outcomes. In addition to an investigation of firm behavior and consumer behavior, attention will be paid to: Game Theory, Behavioral Economics, Economics of Time and Risk, Economics of Information, Experimental Economics, and Auctions and Market Design. Students will also learn how to integrate basic data analysis and statistics.</dd>
